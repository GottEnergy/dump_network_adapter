Hey, when compiling a DMA Firmware (Based on PCLeechs Source),

you will stumble across the issue that you need:

-DSN
-subSys ID's
-Device ID
-Vendor ID
â€‹You could research already posted adresses, but you can also dump them from used or new hardware.

I am too lazy to search for the adresses every single time, so i wrote some script to easly dump all hardware serials from the Network Adapter.



I wont support you with any Firmware related stuff!
If you know how to use it, use it if not DONT ASK ME.
